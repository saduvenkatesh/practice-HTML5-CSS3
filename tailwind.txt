Key Tailwind Classes Used
flex and flex-col

flex: Activates flexbox layout, allowing easy alignment and distribution of child elements(the elements inside it) along a row or column.
flex-col: By default, arranges child elements vertically in a column layout, stacking them one below the other.
md:flex-row

md:: A responsive prefix that targets medium screens (768px and larger).
flex-row: Changes the flex container's layout from a column to a row on medium and larger screens, arranging child elements horizontally side by side.
w-full and md:w-1/4

w-full: Sets the element's width to 100% of its parent container, making it full width on small screens.
md:w-1/4: On medium and larger screens, sets the elementâ€™s width to 25% of the container, making it more compact and allowing for a horizontal layout.
p-4

p-4: Adds padding of 1rem (16px) to all sides of the element, providing consistent spacing around the content and improving visual appeal.
min-h-screen

Ensures the element's height is at least as tall as the viewport height, so the layout fills the screen even if the content inside is minimal.
bg-*

bg-* classes are used to set background colors, like bg-gray-100, which help distinguish different sections and improve the overall visual clarity of the layout.
